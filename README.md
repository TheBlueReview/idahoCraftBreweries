# Idaho Craft Breweries (geo)

This repo provides a csv of Idaho craft breweries, based on the work that Bob Hubler has done at the [Boise Beer Culture website](http://mariah95.com/BEER/index.htm). We added addresses and geocoded his [table of past, present and future breweries](http://mariah95.com/BEER/IdahoBreweries.htm) in Idaho.

This dataset was created for an October 2015 article in The Blue Review: [A Sudsy Mix of Beer and Taxes]( https://thebluereview.org/a-sudsy-mix-of-beer-and-taxes/).

You can issue a pull request here if you see errors or have additions to the table. You can also leave comments on our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FxkQY3o9RI_SEwtsGRzeP5Q-TTe4LT-AD3B2rq0_uyM/edit#gid=0).

The Gsheet is also available as JSON: https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1FxkQY3o9RI_SEwtsGRzeP5Q-TTe4LT-AD3B2rq0_uyM/default/public/values?alt=json

Finally, [view and embed the map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Crx94YOEwqwXkbb3Js5nQqghwHQ) and all hail pint glass map markers.
